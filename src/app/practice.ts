		"MySQL", "What is the difference between primary key and candidate key?", "Primary key in MySQL is use to identify every row of a table in unique manner. For one table there is only one primary key. One of the candidate keys is the primary key and the candidate keys can be used to reference the foreign keys"),
		new FlashCard("Csharp", "What is an Object and a Class?", "A class is an encapsulation of properties and methods that are used to represent a real-time entity. It is a data structure that brings all the instances together in a single unit. An Object in an instance of a Class.Technically, it is just a block of memory allocated that can be stored in the form of Variables, Array or a Collection"

		new FlashCard("Csharp", "What is a property?", "Properties are members that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the values of private fields, in other words by the property we can access private fields. In other words we can say that a property is a return type function/method with one parameter or without a parameter. These are always public data members.

If the variable is made static then it will have a single instance and the value change is updated in this instance"),
		new FlashCard("Csharp", "What are the fundamental OOP concepts?", "The four fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming are:Encapsulation– The Internal representation of an object is hidden from the view outside object’ s definition.Only the required information can be accessed whereas the rest of the data implementation is hidden. Abstraction– It is a process of identifying the critical behavior and data of an object and eliminating the irrelevant details. Inheritance– It is the ability to create new classes from another class.It is done by accessing, modifying and extending the behavior of objects in the parent class. Polymorphism– The name means, one name, many forms.It is achieved by having multiple methods with the same name but different implementations."),

		new FlashCard("Csharp", "What is the difference between public, static and void?", "Public declared variables or methods are accessible anywhere in the application. Static declared variables or methods are globally accessible without creating an instance of the class. Static member are by default not globally accessible it depends upon the type of access modified used. The compiler stores the address of the method as the entry point and uses this information to begin execution before any objects are created. And Void is a type modifier that states that the method or variable does not return any value"),

		new FlashCard("JS", "What are global variables? How are these variable declared and what are the problems associated with using them?", "Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code, that is, these have no scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable or object. If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared. The problems that are faced by using global variables are the clash of variable names of local and global scope.Also, it is difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables."),
